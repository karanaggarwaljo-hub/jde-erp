# Changelog

All notable changes to JDE ERP, in plain language, newest first.

## In progress
- FIFO costing for inventory: purchases of the same item at different prices are tracked as separate cost batches instead of overwriting one price field. Inventory's cost price and margin will reflect the oldest unsold batch (the batch the next sale will actually draw from) and update automatically as batches are used up.

## 2026-07-29 — Desktop app
- Packaged the app as a real installable Windows program (its own window, Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, uninstaller) instead of only a browser tab, using Electron. Download and install from the GitHub Releases page — no cloning code or manual setup files. First launch asks once for the Supabase connection details.
- Fixed a subtle bug where two people changing stock or a balance at almost the same moment (e.g. two computers selling the last unit of the same part) could silently overwrite each other's change. Stock and balance updates now happen atomically in the database instead of being read-then-written from the app.

## 2026-07-28 — Sales improvements
- Added full invoice editing (previously an invoice could only be viewed or deleted, not corrected).
- Added a "Payment Received" field to Sales invoices, matching how Purchases already track payments to suppliers.
- Made the GST rate on invoices manually editable instead of locked at 18%.
- Brought the Sales list up to a cleaner standard: stats row (revenue, transactions, average order value, top product, outstanding due), search, discount column, and working View/Delete actions (replacing a non-functional "Send" button).
- Removed the extra tab bar on the Sales page (Quotations still reachable via a small link).

## 2026-07-28 — Purchases rework
- Rebuilt Purchases into a one-step "Record Purchase" flow: pick or type a supplier (auto-created if new), add line items, save — stock and what you owe the supplier update immediately.
- File-import purchases (CSV/Excel/PDF/photo) now go through the same one-step flow and correctly save their line items.

## 2026-07-28 — Inventory cleanup
- Removed the Compatibility and Loc. columns from the main Inventory table to reduce clutter (the data is still there and editable — just not shown in the list view).
- Added Margin % and Status columns to the Inventory table.
- Fixed CSV import to auto-detect quantity/cost/selling-price columns and handle files with a title row above the real headers.

## 2026-07-28 — Real stock & balance tracking, reporting
- Fixed stock levels and customer/supplier balances not actually tracking real sales and purchases (they were disconnected from real transactions before this fix).
- Added Aging reports (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days) for receivables and payables.
- Added credit limit warnings.
- Removed fabricated/placeholder data from the dashboard and audit log — empty states are now honest instead of showing made-up numbers.

## 2026-07-27 — Multi-company & backend migration
- Migrated the backend to Supabase and added multi-company isolation, laying the groundwork for using this app from more than one computer.

## 2026-07-25 — 2026-07-26 — Initial build
- Initial JDE ERP application built: Next.js 16 + Supabase, core modules (Inventory, Sales, Purchases, Customers, Suppliers, Reports, and more), Gemini-powered AI features (forecasting, insights, daily briefing).

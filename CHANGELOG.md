# Changelog

All notable changes to JDE ERP, in plain language, newest first.

## 2026-08-04 — Website Catalog: delete option added
- You can now delete a catalog listing directly from the Website Catalog list, not just from inside it — with a confirmation first. Delete is available for anything not currently live (draft, unpublished, or archived); a listing that's actively published has to be unpublished first, so nothing disappears off the real website by accident.

## 2026-08-04 — Website Catalog: quick link to a published listing
- The Website Catalog list now has a "View Live" and a copy-link button next to any published item, so you can jump straight to (or grab the link to) the actual website page without opening the item first. Only shows up once something's actually published.

## 2026-08-04 — Website Catalog: description drafts read a lot less like a form letter
- The "Generate Draft" description writer was too conservative — it was just restating the brand/part number/category as sentences ("This is a JCB filter kit under the Filters category...") instead of writing anything useful. It now actually reads the product name and any notes you've typed and pulls out the real specifics already there (a service interval, a standard like BS5, what's bundled in a kit, etc.) into natural-sounding copy and genuinely useful key features — still never inventing anything not already stated in your data, just no longer wasting what you gave it.

## 2026-08-04 — Website Catalog: AI product photos now use your reference photo as a guide
- "Generate with AI" no longer guesses blind from a text description. When you've picked a reference photo in Reference Search, it's now handed to the AI as a visual guide for the real part's shape and proportions, so the result looks much closer to the actual item instead of a generic stand-in. The reference photo itself is never saved or published — only the newly generated image is. Without a reference picked, it still falls back to generating from the text description alone, same as before.
- The Generate with AI button now tells you upfront whether it has a reference photo to work from.
- Worth remembering: even with a reference photo, AI generation is still an approximation, not a copy — uploading a real photo of the actual part remains the only way to guarantee an exact image.

## 2026-08-03 — Website Catalog: publishing now double-checks Inventory first, and a real AI bug got fixed
- Before you can publish a catalog listing, it now compares the price and stock status against what Inventory currently shows. If they've drifted apart (you changed the price, or it sold out, since the draft was made) you'll see exactly what changed and a one-click "Sync from Inventory" button — or you can publish anyway if the difference is intentional. If the part was removed from Inventory entirely, publishing is blocked outright.
- Fixed a real bug: "Generate with AI" for the product photo was failing every time with a confusing error, because the AI image model it was using had been retired by Google. Switched to the current model — this should now work normally (subject to the same daily AI usage limit as every other AI feature here).

## 2026-08-03 — Website Catalog: turn Inventory parts into a public parts website
- New "Website Catalog" section in the sidebar. Pick any part from Inventory to start a draft, fill in what's missing, and step through: search the web for reference photos (guidance only — nothing is ever auto-downloaded or published), generate a locked-down AI image prompt from the approved fields, either generate a photo with AI or upload a real one, draft an editable product description, preview exactly what the public page will show, then publish.
- New public pages at `/catalog` (browse) and `/catalog/[id]` (detail) — visible to anyone, no login needed. They only ever show parts you've explicitly published, and only the customer-safe fields (name, part number, brand, compatibility, category, availability, price or "Request a Quote") — cost price, stock counts, supplier info, and anything still in draft/review are never shown, enforced at the database level, not just hidden in the page.
- Unpublish takes a listing down without deleting your work; Archive retires it for good. Both are separate from Draft so you can always tell what's actually live.
- Added an optional "Quote Request Email / Phone" to Settings → Company — when set, published listings get a working Request a Quote / Call button; left blank, the button is simply hidden rather than showing something broken.
- Every AI step here is a suggestion you review and edit before it's ever shown publicly — nothing publishes automatically, matching how AI already works everywhere else in this app.
- Not included yet (planned for later): search/filtering on the public catalog page, a proper quote-request inbox inside the ERP (for now it's a plain email/call button), and analytics/audit reporting on the catalog itself.
- Worth knowing: this app doesn't have real per-user login anywhere yet (Settings → "Sign In" is a placeholder), so Website Catalog admin actions are protected the same way every other ERP screen is today — not more, not less. The one hard boundary is on the server: only published listings are ever readable by the public site, and only from inside this app.

## 2026-08-01 — Fixed: editing just the cost price didn't always update the displayed margin
- If you edited a part in Inventory to correct its cost price without also changing the stock count, the number shown (and the margin calculated from it) could keep showing the old cost — because that edit only updates the "sticker" field, not the underlying priced batch the display actually reads from. Now correcting the cost price on its own also corrects the batch that's currently in view, so what you type is what you see.

## 2026-08-01 — Reports page redesign
- Every report tab now leads with colorful stat cards (matching the style already used on the Dashboard and Analytics pages) instead of plain text rows, so the headline numbers are readable at a glance.
- Profit & Loss and Stock Valuation each got a visual bar breakdown (revenue vs. costs, and stock value by category) alongside the detailed numbers — nothing removed, just easier to scan before reading the full table.
- Aging's four day-range buckets are now color-coded by urgency (green → amber → orange → red) for both receivables and payables.

## 2026-08-01 — Walk-in sales don't need a customer anymore
- Creating a Sales invoice no longer requires picking a customer — leaving it blank now records the sale as "Walk-in Customer" instead of blocking you. Stock still updates normally; since there's no real customer account behind a walk-in sale, no balance or credit limit is touched. Editing a walk-in invoice later correctly shows it as unselected again rather than getting stuck on the stored label.

## 2026-08-01 — AI added to four more places
- **Customers & Suppliers**: a new sparkle button next to an outstanding balance drafts a ready-to-send payment reminder (or, for suppliers, a payment follow-up) — pulls in the real oldest overdue invoice/PO, editable before you copy and send it.
- **Reports**: every report tab now shows a short AI-written summary explaining what the numbers mean, on top of the tables already there. It only describes what's actually in the data — if a report is empty, it says so plainly instead of inventing a story.
- **Expenses**: typing a description and moving on now suggests a category automatically (still fully overridable from the dropdown).
- **Inventory**: typing a new part's name suggests a category and, only when actually stated in the name (e.g. "Bosch Oil Filter"), a brand — it deliberately leaves brand blank rather than guess one, and never touches vehicle-compatibility data.
- Along the way, fixed a real bug this work surfaced: the Reports AI summary could show stale wrong text (e.g. "no financial activity" next to real revenue numbers) because a fast initial empty-data request could resolve after a slower real-data one. Also cleaned up the raw technical error Gemini returns when its free daily quota is hit, so it now reads as a plain sentence instead of a JSON dump.

## 2026-08-01 — Same fix for Sales invoice lines
- Sales invoice lines had the same visual problem as Purchases: adding a line always pre-filled with your first Inventory item, making it look like every row was stuck on the same part. Every new line now starts unselected ("Select a part…") instead. Unlike Purchases, Sales can't accidentally do nothing here — the part field is a strict dropdown of what's actually in Inventory, not free text, so this was purely a display fix.

## 2026-08-01 — Recording a purchase of a brand-new part
- Fixed: typing a part into Purchases that wasn't already in Inventory silently did nothing — no new item, no stock added — because only new *suppliers* got auto-created, not new *products*. Buying something for the first time now correctly adds it to Inventory (at the price you just paid) and stocks it, the same way a new supplier already got created automatically.
- Fixed: the Product field on a new purchase row used to pre-fill with your first existing part, making it look like you couldn't type anything else. Every row now starts blank with a hint showing whether it matched an existing part or will create a new one.

## 2026-07-31 — FIFO inventory costing
- Buying the same part at a different price no longer overwrites or gets lost — each purchase is now tracked as its own priced batch, and each sale draws from the oldest unsold batch first (First In, First Out). Inventory's cost price and margin now reflect the oldest batch still in stock and update automatically as batches run out, instead of staying frozen at whatever price was set when the part was first added.
- Editing or deleting a sale now precisely un-does what it drew from those batches, rather than a rough guess.
- Manually correcting a stock count in Inventory (typing a new number) also opens or draws down a batch to match, so the batch records never drift out of sync with the actual stock count.
- The cost price shown elsewhere in the app (Reports, Analytics, Dashboard, exports, AI daily briefing) now also updates to the latest purchase price, so it stays consistent with what Inventory shows.

## 2026-07-29 — Desktop app
- Packaged the app as a real installable Windows program (its own window, Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, uninstaller) instead of only a browser tab, using Electron. Download and install from the GitHub Releases page — no cloning code or manual setup files. First launch asks once for the Supabase connection details.
- Fixed a subtle bug where two people changing stock or a balance at almost the same moment (e.g. two computers selling the last unit of the same part) could silently overwrite each other's change. Stock and balance updates now happen atomically in the database instead of being read-then-written from the app.

## 2026-07-28 — Sales improvements
- Added full invoice editing (previously an invoice could only be viewed or deleted, not corrected).
- Added a "Payment Received" field to Sales invoices, matching how Purchases already track payments to suppliers.
- Made the GST rate on invoices manually editable instead of locked at 18%.
- Brought the Sales list up to a cleaner standard: stats row (revenue, transactions, average order value, top product, outstanding due), search, discount column, and working View/Delete actions (replacing a non-functional "Send" button).
- Removed the extra tab bar on the Sales page (Quotations still reachable via a small link).

## 2026-07-28 — Purchases rework
- Rebuilt Purchases into a one-step "Record Purchase" flow: pick or type a supplier (auto-created if new), add line items, save — stock and what you owe the supplier update immediately.
- File-import purchases (CSV/Excel/PDF/photo) now go through the same one-step flow and correctly save their line items.

## 2026-07-28 — Inventory cleanup
- Removed the Compatibility and Loc. columns from the main Inventory table to reduce clutter (the data is still there and editable — just not shown in the list view).
- Added Margin % and Status columns to the Inventory table.
- Fixed CSV import to auto-detect quantity/cost/selling-price columns and handle files with a title row above the real headers.

## 2026-07-28 — Real stock & balance tracking, reporting
- Fixed stock levels and customer/supplier balances not actually tracking real sales and purchases (they were disconnected from real transactions before this fix).
- Added Aging reports (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days) for receivables and payables.
- Added credit limit warnings.
- Removed fabricated/placeholder data from the dashboard and audit log — empty states are now honest instead of showing made-up numbers.

## 2026-07-27 — Multi-company & backend migration
- Migrated the backend to Supabase and added multi-company isolation, laying the groundwork for using this app from more than one computer.

## 2026-07-25 — 2026-07-26 — Initial build
- Initial JDE ERP application built: Next.js 16 + Supabase, core modules (Inventory, Sales, Purchases, Customers, Suppliers, Reports, and more), Gemini-powered AI features (forecasting, insights, daily briefing).
